---------------------

Are you a poor soul that insists on playing Thorium and Calamity at the same time? Then this mod should at least make the experience a bit more barable.
Thorium + Calamity Convergence Mod converges the progression and reduces the redundancy that happens when both mods kinda do the exact same thing.
There's new recipe trees, maybe sometimes new recipes entirely for items, and FINALLY no identical vertebrae > leather recipe gosh dang it.
Since this can go against what much of both the wikis say, I recommend using the Guide for the new recipes or Recipe Browser if you're into that.


Changelog:

v1.0
- Added Blood Orb recipes for all the Thorium potions.
- Fixed the majority of the issues with the mod. Now, should be completely functionnal

v0.1
- Initial release
- Interlaced boot accesory progression. Normal Progression > Angel Treads (moved to post-plantera) > Terrarium Particle Sprinters > Seraph Tracers > Normal Progression
